                               Release Kick-off
**FOR PROGRESS RELATED TO RELEASE CHECKLIST, PLEASE SEE https://github.com/yglazko/standalone **
* Being developed as minimalist stand-alone which will be integrated into Ship-It because it was more helpful for me to be able to test and fix errors more quickly without the bulk of Ship-It.
* Running with a separate database from Ship-It, probably will continue to run with a separate database even post-integration
* Integration will involve consolidating forms into Ship-It forms.py and adding routes to appropriate file in Ship-It. Front-end markup minimal to not interfere with base inheritance of Ship-It U.I.

Release kick-off is a Mozilla "internal" tool used to start the release of
Firefox Desktop, Android and Thunderbird.
This tool is specific to Mozilla workflows and tools.


Dependencies are listed in requirements/*.txt.
* compiled+prod are required to run in production
* compiled+prod+dev are required to run the standalone server/tests

Troubleshooting
* When running "vagrant up", I am getting a error which states, "The guest machine entered an invalid state while waiting for it to boot. Valid states are 'starting, running'. The machine is in the 'poweroff' state. Please verify everything is configured properly and try again."
	There are a few possibilities:
		- OS X Mavericks may be causing problems with the 64-bit vagrant boxes (https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2157)
			- could be a missing kernel driver, there is a hidden virtualbox GUI window that will give more information on errors
		- Make sure you are running
			Vagrant 1.6.3+
			VirtualBox 4.3.6+
		- Switching to a 32-bit vagrant box seems to be a temporary fix
